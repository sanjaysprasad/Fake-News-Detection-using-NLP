# Fake News Detection using Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Project Overview

This project presents a robust machine learning solution developed to combat the growing problem of misinformation. By leveraging advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the system analyzes the textual content of news articles to accurately classify them as either Real (Reliable) or Fake (Unreliable).

The rise of social media has accelerated the spread of fabricated stories. This repository provides the complete pipeline—from data acquisition and cleaning to model training and performance evaluation—for creating an effective automated fact-checking tool.

Key Features

Comprehensive NLP Pipeline: Implements a full text cleaning and preprocessing workflow, including tokenization, stop-word removal, and text normalization.

Advanced Feature Engineering: Utilizes TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization to transform raw text data into meaningful numerical features.

Machine Learning Classifiers: Compares the performance of various classification algorithms, such as:

Passive Aggressive Classifier (PAC)

Logistic Regression

Multinomial Naive Bayes

Performance Evaluation: Rigorous model assessment using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine the best-performing classifier.

Interactive Web Interface (Optional): Includes a simple web application built with Flask/Streamlit for real-time user input and prediction.
